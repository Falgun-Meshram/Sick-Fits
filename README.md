# Sick-Fits
A React application modelling an e-commerce platform with GraphQL endpoints.
This is a Full stack React Application with two layers of front end and two layers at the backend.

The front end consists of ReactJs and the Apollo Client while the backend is made up of the GraphQL Yoga server and 
the Prisma Database interface.

It also uses Next.js for server side rendering along with Styled components for all the styling in the application.

Here are few of the screenshots of the application in action:
